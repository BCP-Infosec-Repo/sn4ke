## Gtirb-capstone 
I modified the baseline Gtirb-capstone module to support capstone in the
context. This is a patch for the master branch and will be merged later on. 

Please get this branch using the following: 

`git clone --depth=1 --branch=wip/dev https://github.com/pwnslinger/gtirb-capstone/` 

and install it effectively: 

`python setup.py install`
